# Decomposition Font Generator

This generator creates a font file that is composed of a subset of glyphs from HanaMinA & HanaMinB, that are not usually recognized in browsers/mobile apps. Basically, if you want to show detailed Chinese character decomposition & unusual Chinese character glyphs, then this generator & resulting font file should do the trick.
